# Clean up the words
# Given a string that consists of some words and 
# an assortment of non-alphabetic characters, write
# a function that returns that string with all of 
# the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. 
# If one or more non-alphabetic characters occur in 
# a row, you should only have one space in the 
# result (i.e., the result string should never have 
# consecutive spaces).
